# WORLD-HAPPINESS-SCORE
Research question: Can Freedom to make life choices/arrangements and Gdp per capita improve The Happiness Score?

#Business Overview
Most people probably believe that happiness is in the eye of the beholder, an individual’s choice,
something to be pursued individually rather than as a matter of national policy. Happiness seems far too
subjective, too vague, to serve as a touchstone for a nation’s goals, much less its policy content. That
indeed has been the traditional view.
Yet the evidence is changing this view rapidly. A generation of studies by psychologists, economists,
pollsters, sociologists, and others has shown that happiness, though indeed a subjective experience,
can be objectively measured, assessed, correlated with observable brain functions, and related to the
characteristics of an individual and the society.
Asking people whether they are happy, or satisﬁed with their lives, offers important information about
the society. It can signal underlying crises or hidden strengths. It can suggest the need for change. Such is
the idea of the emerging scientiﬁc study of happiness, whether of individuals and the choices they
make, or of entire societies and the reports of the citizenry regarding life satisfaction. This analysis
summarizes the fascinating and emerging story of these studies.


#Business Objective
Research question: Can Freedom to make life choices/arrangements and Gdp per capita improve The
Happiness Score?


#Null Hypothesis: People with great freedom of making life choices and a higher Gdp per capita will
report greater happiness score than people with less freedom of making life choices and less Gdp per
capita


#Alternative Hypothesis: People with great freedom of making life choices and a higher Gdp per capita
will not report greater happiness score than people with less freedom of making life choices and less Gdp
per capita.

#Target audience


This project is aimed at informing all groups of people who love, want or need to travel to foreign
countries eg government expatriates, international tourists, pilgrims, asylum seekers e.t.c about the
happiness status of other countries and factors influencing happiness rate in these countries.

We also aim to inform governments in the respective countries on factors influencing the happiness rate
in not only their countries but others too. This will help in better decision making, better policy
formulation and benchmarking.
